    <p>I think the content of my site will add value to the user because it is very simple and its easy to find what they are looking for. Every piece of the website will get to the point with the single word phrases on the nav bar on the header, the attention grabbing content in the home page, it had a photo but the idea is for it to be a video or have a slide effect with photos, and the footer has external link icons for more places they can visit and see more content.</p>
